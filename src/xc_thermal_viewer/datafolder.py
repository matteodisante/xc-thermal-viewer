The folder holds one archive root per discipline (see

startup or from the File menu, and published through an environment variable so that
every :meth:`~xc_thermal_viewer.core.disciplines.Discipline.config` lookup in this
process resolves against it.

No Qt import (see the package docstring): the app and the main window supply the
