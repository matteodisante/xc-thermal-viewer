<h2>Thermal planes</h2>
<p>Each dot is a climb trajectory crossing one horizontal plane.
Colour identifies the discipline. <b>% points</b> adjusts dot opacity from 0 to
100% in every plane panel; it starts at 95%. <b>% background</b> adjusts the map
separately. Opacity changes preserve the selected intersections and their counts.</p>

<h3>Cell selection</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Grid:</b> fixed {cell_km} &times; {cell_km} km squares over the
metropolitan-France map window, in Lambert-93 (EPSG:2154).</li>
<li><b>Count:</b> continuous Vilpellet climb runs, all archived dates and both
disciplines. Each run counts once per cell, including re-entry. Separate runs
from one flight count separately; duration and number of fixes add no weight.</li>
<li><b>Group:</b> by the highest IGN terrain elevation inside the cell.</li>
<li><b>Keep:</b> the three cells with most climbs in each group: 12 total.
Ties use grid coordinates (ix, then iy).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Highest-elevation bands:</b> Plains &lt; {lo} m; Hills {lo}&ndash;&lt;{mid} m;
Low mountains {mid}&ndash;&lt;{hi} m; High mountains &ge; {hi} m.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ranking stays fixed</b> when dates, height or segmentation change.
P, H, L and M identify the groups; rank 1 leads its group.</li>
<li><b>No regional quota or minimum spacing.</b> Nearby alpine cells can win
several places. One summit pixel is enough to lift a cell into a higher band;
categories describe the highest relief, not the typical ground.</li>
<li><b>Whole flights are labelled before clipping.</b> Take-off may be elsewhere.
Only continuous climb segments count; gaps, phase boundaries and isolated fixes
add no crossings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Plane height and terrain source</h3>
<p><b>H = lowest terrain elevation + selected z.</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="{RGE_ALTI_URL}">IGN RGE ALTI</a> supplies ground elevations:
{samples:,} samples per cell, {grid} m apart. Minimum and maximum use unsmoothed
values inside the square, exclude any outer buffer and require complete coverage.</li>
<li>The highest sample sets the <b>terrain category</b>; the lowest sets the
<b>plane reference</b>, so every climb inside the cell reaches some plane.
Launch-altitude statistics in Cell details are retained for comparison only.</li>
<li><b>z</b> is height above the cell's lowest ground. Local clearance varies with
the ground under each dot. The upper limit is the highest supported trajectory
altitude inside the cell minus its lowest terrain.</li>
<li><b>Height increment:</b> spacing between selectable planes (10, 20, 50, 100
or 200 m). Each plane has zero thickness. Intersections are saved every 10 m,
plus the exact highest level; the same z always gives the same dots.</li>
</ul>

<a name="thermal-points"></a><h3>Intersection points</h3>
<ol>
<li>Take consecutive processed fixes labelled <b>climb</b> by Vilpellet,
within one continuous climb run.</li>
<li>For endpoint altitudes z<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>, calculate
<b>f = (H &minus; z<sub>0</sub>) / (z<sub>1</sub> &minus; z<sub>0</sub>)</b>.
Keep 0 &le; f &le; 1; skip horizontal edges.</li>
<li>Interpolate position and time:
<b>(x, y, t) = (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>0</sub>) +
f &times; (&Delta;x, &Delta;y, &Delta;t)</b>.
Coordinates are Lambert-93; time is UTC.</li>
<li>Keep crossings in the visible area and selected time interval.
Both upward and downward crossings count. Shared vertices count once;
terminal crossings are kept.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Example:</b> H = 1,000 m; fixes at 997 and 1,003 m give f = 0.5.
The crossing lies halfway between their positions and times.</p>

<h3>Counts</h3>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="8" width="100%">
<tr><th>Label</th><th>What it counts</th></tr>
<tr><td>Vilpellet climbs</td><td>Continuous climb runs used for ranking.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cell visitors</td><td>Distinct flights crossing the central cell,
any phase or altitude, all dates.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Visible points</td><td>Crossings of this exact plane in the visible area
and selected interval. One flight can add several.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Contributing flights</td><td>Distinct flights behind the visible
points.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>A busy cell can show few dots: flights wholly above or below H contribute none.
For a lowest terrain of 289 m and z = 100 m, only crossings at H = 389 m count.</p>

<h3>Navigation and time</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>3D terrain · selected cell:</b> opens the cell selected in this tab,
with IGN terrain and all intersections every 20 m above the cell's
lowest terrain. It uses the selected dates and daily hour window, when enabled,
and always Vilpellet. Choose a 5 or
10 km square centred on the cell. Left drag rotates, Shift + drag (or right
drag) pans, and scroll/pinch zooms. Point opacity and size are adjustable; turning off
Terrain reveals points behind it. All axes use metres without vertical
exaggeration. Choose Terrain colours or Aerial photo · IGN to change the surface
appearance. Both use existing offline data. Click the 3D button again to apply
a changed cell, date or hour selection. The 3D window's own <b>Info</b> explains
its point selection, terrain, snapshot behaviour and navigation.</li>
<li><b>Zoom + / &minus;:</b> visible width 0.5&ndash;10 km. Drag with the toolbar's
hand tool. Navigation covers the selected cell and its eight neighbours.
<b>Reset cell</b> returns to the central {cell_km} &times; {cell_km} km square.</li>
<li><b>Neighbours:</b> include their own visiting flights at the same absolute H.
The dashed square marks the central cell. Zoom and pan persist across height
and background changes.</li>
<li><b>Calendar:</b> Europe/Paris time. UTC comes from the IGC header, first fix
and trimming offset. Flights without recoverable UTC remain in the cell population
but cannot enter a calendar interval.</li>
<li><b>Daily hour window:</b> one panel with the same Paris clock hours on every
selected day; the default is 08:00 to 18:00, end excluded. An end of 00:00 means
midnight at the end of the day. Changing hours filters the loaded points.
<b>Start / end dates</b> offers <b>From day</b> and
<b>To day</b>, both included. Set both dates, then click <b>Load climb
intersections</b>; the hour window repeats on each day. The range is remembered
per cell and is independent of Whole interval.</li>
<li><b>Days around a date:</b> retains the reference day and before/after offsets.
<b>Busiest summer day</b> selects the recommended June&ndash;August day alone
in direct-date mode, or resets the reference day in relative mode.</li>
<li><b>Same dates every year:</b> pool a season over the selected start years.
An end before the start day continues into the next year. A 29 February bound
becomes 28 February in common years. Only the selected seasonal days and their
Paris hour windows contribute.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Flight data and limits</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Source:</b> {FLIGHT_SOURCE_HTML}. IGC positions, GNSS altitudes and times
supply the trajectories. Vilpellet supplies the climb labels.</li>
<li><b>Altitude:</b> recorder GNSS datums are not harmonised with IGN normal
heights. The height difference retains this uncertainty.</li>
<li><b>Interpolation:</b> straight segments approximate curved paths;
error grows with fix spacing and curvature.</li>
<li><b>Dots:</b> trajectory crossings. Several can belong to one thermal;
thermal centres are not estimated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Backgrounds and access</h3>
{background_sources_html()}
{aerial_dates_html()}
<ul>
<li><b>Saved images:</b> IGN cell maps 4,000 &times; 4,000 pixels
({CELL_M / 4000:g} m/pixel); hillshade 600 &times; 600. Pixel size is sampling,
not positional accuracy. Background opacity starts at 85%.</li>
<li><b>Offline:</b> prepared crossings, neighbours and maps are read from the
data folder.</li>
<li><b>Provenance:</b> saved elevation queries, retrieval dates, raster hashes
and coverage make the terrain references traceable.
IGN data: <a href="{LICENCE_OUVERTE}">Licence Ouverte 2.0</a>.</li>
