<tr><td><a name="tab-trajectory"></a><b>Trajectory</b></td><td>
One IGC flight, raw and reprocessed with the current configuration.
Vilpellet phase labels colour the cleaned path. Gaps remain separate.
Climb runs describe the segmentation, not distinct thermals.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="tab-map"></a><b>Map</b></td><td>
One first free-flight position per retained flight. An adaptive degree grid counts
launches; zoomed views allow individual-flight inspection. Terrain filters here
use launch altitude.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="tab-planes"></a><b>Thermal planes</b><br>
<a name="thermal-points"></a>Intersection points</td><td>
Twelve fixed 5 &times; 5 km cells: three per highest-ground-elevation category, ranked
by continuous Vilpellet climb runs. Dots interpolate climb crossings of
H = lowest IGN terrain + z, within the selected dates, optionally restricted to the
same Paris hours on each day. One flight may add many dots;
unique contributing flights are counted separately. Ranking stays fixed.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="tab-density"></a><b>Thermal density</b></td><td>
Cumulative climb hours/km² over all dates and heights. Split edge durations over
50 m pixels, then divide seconds by 3600 and pixel area. Regions and cells use
Vilpellet climb runs on the native fixes. Both disciplines contribute.
This is residence time, not thermal counts.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="tab-routes"></a><b>Routes · 50&ndash;300 km</b></td><td>
Cleaned flights sharing directed 10 &times; 10 km endpoint cells. Distance is between
cell centres; ranks use retained elapsed duration. At most 300 flights preserve
both groups of five duration extremes. An optional day and departure-time window
filters the entire pair before ranking and sampling, for comparing departure cohorts.
The table includes departure/arrival dates
in Europe/Paris. Terrain and imagery provide context; the thermal overlay uses
all classified flights, independently of the displayed route sample.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a name="tab-3d"></a><b>3D terrain</b></td><td>
Snapshot of the selected Thermal planes cell and dates, in a 5 or 10 km square.
All saved Vilpellet crossings every 20 m above the central cell's lowest ground,
without random thinning. Terrain and points use metres with no vertical
exaggeration.</td></tr>

France/world context for the current route footprint and endpoint cells.
Expand map provides zoom and pan without altering the selected flights.</td></tr>
