"""Loading one flight for the viewer: the raw track, and the cleaned one alongside it.

No Qt or matplotlib import here (see the package docstring): this module is the
Qt-free logic layer, exercised directly by ``tests/viewer/test_data.py``.

Two independent reads of the same ``.igc`` file, not one shared parse feeding both:
:func:`load_raw` stops after stage (i)
(:mod:`xc_thermal_viewer.core.preproc.altchannel`),
:func:`load_cleaned` runs the full seven-stage pipeline
(:func:`xc_thermal_viewer.core.preproc.pipeline.run_flight`). Re-parsing a single
flight's
text is negligible next to either the pipeline itself or a mouse click, and it keeps
each function a self-contained entry point that only needs a path.
