"""Pre-processing thresholds, loaded from ``configs/preprocessing.yaml``.

Every value the pipeline acts on lives in that file rather than in code, so a threshold
can be changed, quoted in the thesis through a generated macro, and audited, without a
source edit. This module is the typed view of it: one frozen dataclass per pipeline
stage and one loader that fails loudly on a missing key.

class FixLevelThresholds:
    """Operational bounds for fix-level cleaning (loaded from the config).

    The horizontal speeds are great-circle (haversine) speeds between consecutive
    fixes, on the raw geographic coordinates (no conversion yet). The vertical-speed and
    altitude bounds apply to the adopted GNSS channel. Inter-fix gaps are not bounded
    here: they are handled once, at the flight level, by :class:`SamplingThresholds`.

    ``max_vertical_speed_mps`` bounds a *local* vertical speed, not a per-step one: the
    median of ``|v_z|`` over the steps within ``vz_window_s`` of each step
    (``xc_thermal_viewer.core.preproc.cleaning.local_vz``). The median reduces
    sensitivity
    to isolated increments but is not immune to GNSS noise or real extreme motion.
    ``vz_min_window_fixes`` is the minimum finite support for using the median;
    below it, the per-step value stands in. The separate out-and-back detector
    also compares per-step magnitudes against ``max_vertical_speed_mps``.

    ``max_horizontal_speed_mps`` is keyed by discipline (``"paragliders"``,
    ``"hang gliders"``, later ``"sailplanes"``): the two types have markedly different
    horizontal-speed envelopes (thesis, fig:fixlevel), so one shared bound is either too
    loose for the slower type or clips real dynamics of the faster one.
    ``max_vertical_speed_mps`` and the altitude bounds are *not* split by discipline:
    the two disciplines' vertical-speed distributions are close enough that splitting
    it buys nothing, and the altitude bounds are about the receiver's plausible reading
    range, not a discipline-specific performance limit.

    The same pair of conditions is asked of two channels, for two different purposes
    (thesis, sec:altchannel). A channel is *present* when enough of the fixes carry a
    non-zero value, and *alive* when its total range over the flight clears a floor -- a
    channel can be present yet dead, a stuck sensor writing a constant that passes the
    presence check and would feed the segmentation a vertical velocity of identically
    zero.

    On the **GNSS** channel, the one the analysis reads, failing either test means the
    flight has no vertical coordinate and is dropped. On the **barometric** channel it
    decides only whether the flight has a usable frozen-lock witness (sec:fixlevel); a
    flight without one keeps the weaker test on the recorder's own declarations. The two
    pairs are separate keys rather than one shared pair because they answer to different
    consequences, and a value that is right for admitting a flight need not be right for
    trusting an instrument.
