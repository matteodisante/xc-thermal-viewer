"""Vilpellet's binary-feature flight-phase segmenter, ported from the authors' code.

This package is a port, not a second attempt at the problem.  It reproduces the
segmentation of Vilpellet et al. (2026) as their code performs it: three binary
features per fix, a three-state hidden Markov model whose emissions are a categorical
law over the eight possible feature triples, Viterbi decoding under parameters fitted
once on 2019 Alpine paraglider flights, and a rolling majority vote over the decoded
path.  No parameter is re-estimated here.

It is the only segmentation this viewer uses.

Typical use::

    from xc_thermal_viewer.core.vilpellet import (
        load_vilpellet_config, segment_flight,
    )

    config = load_vilpellet_config()
    track = segment_flight(result.fixes, config, discipline="paragliders")
    climb = track.fixes.loc[track.fixes["phase"] == "climb"]
