"""The seven stages, chained: one IGC file in, trajectory and audit products out.

This is the only place the pipeline order of sec:preproc is written down as code, and it
is not an implementation choice -- it is argued in the thesis and is fixed::

    (i)   altitude channel      -> the adopted `alt`, and the barometric witness
    (ii)  fix-level cleaning    -> deletions, invalidations, split markers
    (iii) ground trimming       -> the airborne window, and the clock zero
          integrity gate        -> counted over that window, hence here and not in (ii)
    (iv)  flight-level filter   -> keep or drop, with the reason
    (v)   geographic -> ENU     -> the local frame, and its origin
    (vi)  uniform resampling    -> segments, and the reconstructed points
    (vii) Savitzky-Golay        -> the smoothed kinematics

Stages (i)-(iv) act on the raw geographic coordinates, because the only geometry they
need is a scalar distance, which the haversine formula gives directly from latitude and
longitude. The conversion (v) then runs on the cleaned, trimmed track, so the tangent
frame uses retained data, and (vi)-(vii) come last because they produce *vector*
quantities, which need Cartesian axes to be expressed in.

A flight that fails a gate stops there. It still produces a ``flights_meta`` row, with
the reason: the census of what the pipeline removed is as much a result as the
trajectories it keeps.

# Bumped whenever a stage changes what it produces, so a stored table can be told apart
# from one written by an older pipeline (design principle: traceability).
#
# 1.1.0 -- three rules changed after the first full-archive run exposed defects the
#          specification had not anticipated: the impossibility gate deletes without
#          requiring the Hampel flag (the identifier's 50 % breakdown point is exceeded
#          by scattered null-island runs), an impossible step that survives the scan is
#          made a segment boundary and counted, and a flight whose mean ground speed
#          exceeds the fix-level bound is dropped (sec:fixlevel, sec:flightfilter).
# 1.3.0 -- the vertical channel's reconstruction is recorded. A z the logger never
#          wrote, or the cleaning removed, was bridged by a straight line of unbounded
#          length while `interpolated` -- a statement about the *time base* -- reported
#          the grid point as measured: 500 s of invented altitude, 540 m of error, and
#          `was_resampled` False. New per-fix `z_reconstructed`, per-segment
#          `frac_z_reconstructed`, per-flight `z_gap_max_s` (sec:uniform). In the same
#          pass, from the adversarial audit of the same day: the ground-flatness test
#          reads a central span instead of a full range, which is a maximum statistic
#          that grew with the stint and stopped the guard firing at all (sec:trimming);
#          an unreturned vertical step -- neither spike nor run, and present on 8 % of
#          flights -- is counted as `n_alt_level_shift`; the reach bound is stated per
#          fix, as the invariant is; a flight the pipeline raised on carries the fixed
#          reason `pipeline_raised` instead of an exception string the census cannot
#          count; and `suspect_intervals` is written rather than discarded.
# 1.2.0 -- two rules added for the corrupt *first* fix, a defect no per-step test can
#          see because every step of such a flight is plausible: a corrupt block at the
#          very start is deleted rather than made a boundary, and a flight whose extent
#          exceeds what the speed bound allows in its duration is dropped. That first
#          fix becomes the origin of the local frame, so getting it wrong displaces
#          every coordinate of the record (sec:fixlevel, sec:flightfilter).
# 1.3.1 -- the IGC parser requires the *degrees* field of a coordinate to be digits, as
#          it already required the minutes. `int` accepts a leading sign or space, so
#          "-123456N" decoded to a plausible latitude instead of being rejected.
#          No table changes: a scan of 3000 files across both archives (21M records)
#          found no such token, and the rule can only reject what was accepted before.
# 2.0.0 -- one altitude channel for the whole archive, and a local test to go with it.
#          Stage (i) no longer chooses between the barometric and GNSS altitudes per
#          flight: it adopts GNSS everywhere and *gates* on it, dropping a flight whose
#          GNSS channel is absent or stuck, where such a flight used to fall back
#          (sec:altchannel). A mixed population makes the vertical coordinate a
#          different physical quantity from flight to flight, and any correlation
#          between which sensor a logger carried and how it flew then enters the
#          statistics as a selection effect. The barometer survives as an *instrument*:
#          the flat-baro witness of the frozen-lock rule and of the interior-ground
#          guard now read the RAW baro channel, since the adopted altitude comes from
#          the very receiver whose lock is in doubt and cannot witness against itself; a
#          flight with no usable barometer keeps the weaker declaration test, and the
#          ground guard abstains outright rather than falling back to speed alone. In
#          the same pass, forced by the same change: the |v_z| bound moved from the step
#          between two fixes to the MEDIAN of |v_z| over the steps within `vz_window_s`,
#          with a fix censored when the step into it and the step out of it are both in
#          such a neighbourhood. The per-step form condemned a wind gust, which carries
#          one step past the bound without carrying its neighbours there, and -- on the
#          GNSS channel -- the vertical noise floor itself: sigma = 12 m at 1 Hz,
#          plausible for the noisy-GNSS minority this archive measures directly, puts
#          the largest per-step |v_z| at 36.3 m/s on a clean flight, against a window
#          median of 15.8. The bound itself is re-measured from the GNSS channel rather
#          than carried over from the barometric per-step regime: 13.0 -> 30.0, since
#          the bin-to-bin-ratio method that placed the horizontal bounds does not
#          transfer to a statistic the windowing has already made robust to single-fix
#          artifacts (historical 2.0.0 operating point). New counter
#          `n_alt_vz_sustained`; `n_vz_runs` changes meaning, from
#          coherent runs left in place to distinct runs censored. The V flag now
#          invalidates the altitude on every flight, not only the fallback minority.
#          Major bump: no stored table from 1.x is comparable.
# 2.0.1: pressure witnesses require complete local paired-fix coverage for frozen
#        positions and interior-ground intervals; absent raw pressure values are
#        normalised before duplicate merging. Rebuild 2.0.0 tables to adopt it.
# 2.1.0: default windowed vertical-speed threshold lowered from 30 to 10 m/s,
#        at the empirical change into the slower-decaying raw-distribution tail.
#        This changes altitude censoring and requires rebuilding derived tables.
# 2.2.0: propagate reconstructed-altitude support through the vertical SG fit.
# 2.3.0: apply g_max to consecutive finite altitudes; exclude long vertical holes
#        and unsupported endpoints from the full trajectory before resampling.
