"""Stage (i): GNSS-altitude eligibility and barometric-witness eligibility.

Every admitted flight uses the numerical GNSS altitude field. Presence and full-flight
range are operational admission criteria, not proof of local accuracy or sensor health.
The barometer has separate eligibility criteria and supports the frozen-position and
interior-ground detectors; each candidate additionally requires complete local pairing.
Missing GNSS values remain missing until flagged reconstruction at resampling.

GNSS fields are not yet harmonized across geoid/ellipsoid recorder conventions, so
using one named channel does not establish a common geodetic altitude datum.
