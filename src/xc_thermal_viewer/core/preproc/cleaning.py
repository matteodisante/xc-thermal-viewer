"""Fix-level cleaning before projection, resampling and smoothing.

Position and time rules remove selected fixes; altitude rules invalidate only that
channel. These are operational decisions, not a guarantee that every removed fix
is erroneous or every retained fix is correct. Slowly varying errors can survive,
and interpolation cannot reconstruct unobserved manoeuvres.

After timestamp handling, Hampel residuals identify and attribute candidates, while
the horizontal impossibility/rejoin gate controls deletion independently of the
flag. Collapsed or exactly repeated coordinate runs are tested for duration and
witness support. Removed frozen-run intervals force segment boundaries. Altitude
uses absolute bounds, adjacent windowed speed tests and isolated return-spike rules.

Distances here are spherical great-circle approximations on raw geodetic
coordinates. The later ENU transform and smoothing define different coordinates,
so a speed bound enforced here is not a bound on every smoothed output step.
The integrity gate is called after trimming and measures reconstruction burden
over the retained airborne interval, without estimating a true defect rate.

    # spike three seconds in deleted the good fixes and promoted the spike to

    # the split index is `pending[0]`, the first fix of the block that could not be
    # rejoined, and that block is *after* the step whenever the corruption simply
    # outlasts `block_span_s`. A 50 s corrupt run five seconds in therefore deleted
    # five good fixes, kept fifty bad ones, and left the origin 5039 km out. The
    # scan's verdict says a discontinuity exists; it does not say which side of it
    # the record belongs to, and at the very start there is no trend behind the step
    # to settle it.
    #
    # So the discontinuity is left as a discontinuity, and the guarantee is taken
    # where it can be stated without attributing blame: at the flight level, where a
    # record whose own first fix is out of reach of the rest is refused whole
    # (sec:flightfilter). That bound never depended on this rule. What the rule
    # would have bought is the recovery of two flights in 156017 -- against a
    # failure mode that has now been demonstrated twice.

    # Postcondition, and the reason it is stated as one rather than left to the scan:
    # whatever the scan decided, no step *between two surviving fixes* may still break
    # the absolute bound. Where the scan keeps a block it could neither rejoin nor
    # explain, the step back out of that block is exactly such a step, and without this
    # it would enter a segment as flown motion -- a 40 km jump inside one second, which
    # then carries every average computed over that segment. A step the bound rejects
    # is a transition of unknown course, so it is made a boundary, on the same footing
    # as a long gap. It is enforced on the final surviving set, in `clean_flight`.

    """The largest displacement across a boundary this stage declared, in metres.

    A boundary is a statement that the trajectory between two fixes is unknown, and the
    two kinds this stage produces differ in a way that matters downstream. Excising a
    frozen-lock run leaves the position on either side genuine; splitting at a
    re-acquisition offset does not, because the jump is the instrument's and everything
    after it carries an unknown constant. Segments keep the parent's origin
    (sec:uniform), so that constant enters the *ensemble* MSD, which is built from
    absolute position -- while leaving the time-averaged one, built from increments,
    untouched.

    Measured on the cleaned track, which is *before* trimming, so it is an upper bound
    on the displacement that actually reaches the analysis rather than that displacement
    itself -- a jump inside a ground phase counts here and is then trimmed away. On the
    archive the two differ at the tail and nowhere else: the largest value over retained
    paraglider flights is thousands of kilometres while their largest retained extent is
    555 km, which is exactly such a ground-phase jump. The quantity that matters is the
    displacement across a boundary of a *retained* segment, and it is measured where it
    can be measured honestly -- on the written table, by the thesis repository's
    dataset verification, which streams it anyway.

    No rule is applied to either: the effect is small and bounding it is worth more than
    guessing at it. On a sample of the archive the median such displacement is 20 m for
    paragliders and 80 m for hang gliders, the 90th percentile 150 m and 450 m; only
    0.55 % and 1.25 % of flights carry one over a kilometre, and the handful over
    100 km are the corrupt records the reach bound of sec:flightfilter refuses whole.
    Reporting the maximum per flight is what lets that statement be checked rather than
    asserted, and lets an analysis of absolute position exclude on it if it must.

    whose midpoint falls within ``+/- window_s`` of it.

    The median describes a neighbourhood rather than a single increment. With an

    with an even number, the average of the two central order statistics decides.
    Isolated excursions therefore need not trigger this statistic, and are tested

    This is not a noise-free velocity estimate: sufficiently strong GNSS noise or

    unknown, which is what a long gap is, so it is marked as one (sec:fixlevel).

    Stated and enforced as a property of the output rather than as one more case inside
    a detector, so that it holds by construction instead of by the detectors having
    enumerated every way a track can be corrupt -- and applied after all of them, since
    each deletion creates adjacencies the previous pass never saw.

    Args:
        t: Fix times.
        lat: Latitudes in degrees.
        lon: Longitudes in degrees.
        deleted: Which fixes the detectors removed.
        split: The split markers, updated in place.
        max_speed_mps: The discipline's absolute horizontal-speed bound.

    Returns:
        How many boundaries this had to add that no detector had marked. Returned rather
        than kept quiet: a repair made in silence is a diagnosis lost, and a large count
        would indict the detectors rather than the data.
