"""Semantic colours and typography for figures printed at thesis text width.

Colour here is a variable, not decoration. Each comparison the thesis draws owns a
set below, and a reader who learns one set can carry it from chapter to chapter.
Two rules keep that promise:

* The discipline pair and the equipment pair are reserved for the whole document.
  Blue always means paraglider, terracotta always means hang glider, violet and
  ochre always mean the two equipment classes, and nothing else ever uses those
  five values. These are the two comparisons Chapter 3 sets side by side, so a
  shared colour between them would be read as a shared meaning.
* The remaining sets are each internally distinct and avoid the reserved five.
  They may sit in neighbouring hue bands, because no figure and no chapter shows
  two of them at once: take-off regions belong to Chapters 2 and 3, flight phases
  to Chapter 4, and the channel and component sets label the axes of one figure.

Add a comparison by adding a set here, never by choosing a colour at the call
site. ``tests/reporting/test_palette.py`` checks both rules.

Importing this module does not change Matplotlib settings. Reporting entry points
call ``paper_style`` before drawing; numerical analysis never needs Matplotlib.
